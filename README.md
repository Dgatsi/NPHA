# NPHA
Overview-
This project focuses on predicting two different target variables, namely Mental Health and Trouble Sleeping, using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset utilized for this analysis is the National Poll on Healthy Aging (NPHA) dataset.

Introduction-
 this project was inspired by certain motivation and goals keeping the current trends in mind:-
## Motivation:
1.Addressing the growing concern of mental health issues and sleep-related problems within the population.
2.Utilizing data to gain insights into factors affecting mental health and sleep patterns in the context of healthy aging.
3.Developing predictive models to identify potential risk factors for mental health issues and sleeping disorders in the aging population
4.Contribute to preventive healthcare initiatives by identifying early indicators that may lead to mental health challenges or sleep disturbances.
5.Provide valuable information to healthcare professionals for personalized patient care and interventions.

## Goals:
1.To develop accurate machine learning models to predict Mental Health and Trouble Sleeping based on relevant features from the NPHA dataset.
2. To compare the performance of different machine learning algorithms (KNN, SVM, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree) to understand their strengths and limitations in predicting the target variables.
3. To Identify and analyze features that significantly contribute to the prediction of Mental Health and Trouble Sleeping.
4. Strive for model interpretability to provide understandable insights for both technical and non-technical audiences.
5.To translate the results into actionable insights for healthcare practitioners, policymakers, and individuals to enhance mental health and sleep-related outcomes.
6.Document the entire project comprehensively to ensure transparency, reproducibility, and the sharing of knowledge within the scientific and data science communities.
